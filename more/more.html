        <h1>How is Alzheimer’s disease treated?</h1>
        <p>Medical management can improve quality of life for individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease and for their caregivers. There is currently no known cure for Alzheimer’s disease. Treatment addresses several areas:</p>
        <ol style=list-style-type:disc>
            <li>Helping people maintain brain health.</li>
            <li>Managing behavioral symptoms.</li>
            <li>Slowing or delaying symptoms of the disease.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>What Causes Alzheimer’s?</h1>
        <p>The causes of Alzheimer’s disease are not yet fully understood, but probably include a combination of:</p>
        <ol style=list-style-type:disc>
            <li>Age-related changes in the brain, like shrinking, inflammation, blood vessel damage, and breakdown of energy within cells, which may harm neurons and affect other brain cells.</li>
            <li>Changes or differences in genes, which may be passed down by a family member. Both types of Alzheimer's — the very rare early-onset type occurring between age 30 and mid-60s, and the most common late-onset type occurring after a person’s mid-60s — can be related to a person’s genes in some way. Many people with Down syndrome, a genetic condition, will develop Alzheimer’s as they age and may begin to show symptoms in their 40s.</li>
            <li>Health, environmental, and lifestyle factors that may play a role, such as exposure to pollutants, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.</li>

        <h1>Symptoms of Alzheimer's</h1>
        <p>Memory problems are often one of the first signs of Alzheimer’s. Symptoms vary from person to person, and may include problems with:</p>
        <ol style=list-style-type:disc>
            <li>Word-finding, or having more trouble coming up with words than other people the same age.</li>
            <li>Vision and spatial issues, like awareness of the space around them.</li>
            <li>Impaired reasoning or judgment, which can impact decisions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other symptoms may be changes in the person’s behavior, including:</p>
        <ol style=list-style-type:disc>
            <li>Taking longer to complete normal daily tasks.</li>
            <li>Repeating questions.</li>
            <li>Trouble handling money and paying bills.</li>
            <li>Wandering and getting lost.</li>
            <li>Losing things or misplacing them in odd places.</li>
            <li>Mood and personality changes.</li>
            <li>Increased anxiety and/or aggression.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>What Are the Stages of Alzheimer’s?</h1>
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease slowly gets worse over time. People with this disease progress at different rates and in several stages. Symptoms may get worse and then improve, but until an effective treatment for the disease itself is found, the person’s ability will continue to decline over the course of the disease.</p>
        <ol style=list-style-type:disc>
            <li><span>Early-stage Alzheimer’s</span> is when a person begins to experience memory loss and other cognitive difficulties, though the symptoms appear gradual to the person and their family. Alzheimer’s disease is often diagnosed at this stage.</li>
            <li>During <span>middle-stage Alzheimer’s,</span> damage occurs in areas of the brain that control language, reasoning, sensory processing, and conscious thought. People at this stage may have more confusion and trouble recognizing family and friends.</li>
            <li>In <span>late-stage Alzheimer’s,</span> a person cannot communicate, is completely dependent on others for care, and may be in bed most or all the time as the body shuts down..</li>

        <h1>The role of plaques and tangles</h1>
        <p>Two abnormal structures called plaques and tangles are prime suspects in damaging and killing nerve cells.</p>
        <ol style=list-style-type:disc>
            <li>Plaques are deposits of a protein fragment called beta-amyloid (BAY-tuh AM-uh-loyd) that build up in the spaces between nerve cells.</li>
            <li>Tangles are twisted fibers of another protein called tau (rhymes with “wow”) that build up inside cells.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Though autopsy studies show that most people develop some plaques and tangles as they age, those with Alzheimer’s tend to develop far more and in a predictable pattern, beginning in the areas important for memory before spreading to other regions.</p>
