            <li>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia.</li>
            <li>It is a progressive disease beginning with mild memory loss and possibly leading to loss of the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to the environment.</li>
            <li>Alzheimer’s disease involves parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language.</li>
            <li>It can seriously affect a person’s ability to carry out daily activities.</li>

            <li>In 2020, as many as 5.8 million Americans were living with Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
            <li>Younger people may get Alzheimer’s disease, but it is less common.</li>
            <li>The number of people living with the disease doubles every 5 years beyond age 65.</li>
            <li>This number is projected to nearly triple to 14 million people by 2060.</li>
            <li>Symptoms of the disease can first appear after age 60, and the risk increases with age.</li>

        <h1>What is known about Alzheimer’s Disease?</h1>
        <p>Scientists do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer’s disease. There likely is not a single cause but rather several factors that can affect each person differently.</p>
        <ol style=list-style-type:disc>
            <li>Age is the best known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
            <li>Family history—researchers believe that genetics may play a role in developing Alzheimer’s disease. However, genes do not equal destiny. A healthy lifestyle may help reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Two large, long term studies indicate that adequate physical activity, a nutritious diet, limited alcohol consumption, and not smoking may help people. To learn more about the study.</li>
            <li>Changes in the brain can begin years before the first symptoms appear.</li>
            <li>Researchers are studying whether education, diet, and environment play a role in developing Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
            <li>There is growing scientific evidence that healthy behaviors, which have been shown to prevent cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, may also reduce risk for subjective cognitive decline.</li>

        <h1>What to do if you suspect Alzheimer’s disease?</h1>
        <p>Getting checked by your healthcare provider can help determine if the symptoms you are experiencing are related to Alzheimer’s disease, or a more treatable conditions such as a vitamin deficiency or a side effect from medication. Early and accurate diagnosis also provides opportunities for you and your family to consider financial planning, develop advance directives, enroll in clinical trials, and anticipate care needs.</p>
